# ðŸ§  Java Memory Management & Garbage Collection

Java's memory management and garbage collection (GC) play a vital role in optimizing memory usage, improving performance, and preventing memory leaks.

## **Java Memory Management**

Java's memory management is handled by the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**, which uses various memory areas to optimize performance and allocate space for objects and method calls.

### **Key Memory Areas in JVM:**

1. **Heap Memory:**
   - The **heap** is where **objects** are stored.
   - It is divided into:
     - **Young Generation:** New objects are created here. Includes:
       - **Eden Space** (for newly created objects).
       - **Survivor Space** (for objects that survived garbage collection).
     - **Old Generation:** Stores long-lived objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles.
   - **Garbage Collection** primarily focuses on the **Young Generation**.

2. **Stack Memory:**
   - Stores **method frames** (activation records), **local variables**, and **method calls**.
   - Each thread has its own stack, organized in a **LIFO** (Last-In-First-Out) manner.

3. **Method Area:**
   - Stores **class-level data**, such as:
     - Class definitions.
     - Static variables.
     - Method data.
     - Constant pool.
   - Known as **PermGen** (pre-Java 7) or **Metaspace** (from Java 8 onwards).

4. **Program Counter (PC) Register:**
   - Stores the address of the currently executing instruction for each thread.

5. **Native Method Stack:**
   - Used for executing **native** (non-Java) code through the **JNI** (Java Native Interface).

## **Garbage Collection (GC) in Java**

Garbage Collection is the process by which the **JVM** automatically identifies and removes objects that are no longer in use, freeing up memory and ensuring the program doesn't run out of memory.

### **How Garbage Collection Works:**
1. **Object Creation:** Objects are created in the heap memory.
2. **Reachability:** An object is reachable if it can be accessed through a chain of references from active threads, static variables, or JNI.
3. **Unreachable Objects:** Objects with no references become **unreachable** and are eligible for garbage collection.
4. **GC Process:** The **Garbage Collector** reclaims memory by removing unreachable objects.

### **Types of Garbage Collectors in Java**

Java offers several different types of garbage collectors, each optimized for different use cases:

1. **Serial Garbage Collector:**
   - Uses a **single thread** for garbage collection.
   - Suitable for small applications.
   - Command: `-XX:+UseSerialGC`

2. **Parallel Garbage Collector:**
   - Uses multiple threads for **minor GC** operations in parallel.
   - Suitable for larger heap sizes.
   - Command: `-XX:+UseParallelGC`

3. **Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Collector:**
   - Minimizes **pause times** by working concurrently with the application threads.
   - Not ideal for very large heaps.
   - Command: `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`

4. **G1 Garbage Collector:**
   - Designed for large heaps and low-pause time requirements.
   - Divides the heap into regions and performs **stop-the-world pauses**.
   - Command: `-XX:+UseG1GC`

5. **Z Garbage Collector (ZGC):**
   - **Low-latency** garbage collector for applications with large heaps.
   - Focuses on minimizing GC pause times.
   - Command: `-XX:+UseZGC`

6. **Shenandoah Garbage Collector:**
   - Similar to **ZGC** and focuses on **low-latency**.
   - A newer addition to the JVM.
   - Command: `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`

### **GC Phases**

Garbage Collection occurs in multiple phases:

1. **Mark Phase:**
   - The **root objects** are marked, and reachable objects are identified.
   
2. **Sweep Phase:**
   - Unreachable objects are removed from the heap.

3. **Compact Phase:**
   - In some GC collectors, the remaining objects are **compactly arranged** to reduce memory fragmentation.

### **GC Algorithms in Detail:**

1. **Minor GC (Young Generation Collection):**
   - Occurs when the **Young Generation** is full.
   - Objects are copied from **Eden Space** to **Survivor Spaces**.
   - Objects that survive multiple minor GCs are promoted to the **Old Generation**.

2. **Major GC (Full GC or Old Generation Collection):**
   - Occurs when the **Old Generation** is full.
   - It scans the entire heap, which can be expensive in terms of time and resources.

3. **Stop-The-World Pause:**
   - During garbage collection, all **application threads** are paused.
   - The duration of this pause is crucial to application performance.

### **Garbage Collection Tuning Tips**

- **Heap Size Tuning:**  
  Adjust heap size based on your applicationâ€™s memory needs:
  - `-Xms` for initial heap size.
  - `-Xmx` for maximum heap size.

- **GC Logs:**  
  Enable garbage collection logging to monitor performance:
  - `-Xlog:gc*` (Java 9+)
  - `-verbose:gc` (Java 8 and below)

- **Garbage Collector Choice:**  
  Select the right garbage collector:
  - **G1** for large heaps with low pause times.
  - **ZGC** or **Shenandoah** for ultra-low latency applications.

- **Heap Dumps:**  
  Capture heap dumps for **OutOfMemoryError** situations to analyze memory:
  - `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`

## **Conclusion:**

Javaâ€™s memory management and garbage collection are fundamental concepts for optimizing application performance. Understanding how memory is allocated, how garbage is collected, and how to tune the JVM for different scenarios is essential for writing efficient Java applications.

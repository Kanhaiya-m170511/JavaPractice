This document provides a detailed explanation of **Data Types**, **Variables**,and **Type Casting** in Java.

---

## **1. Data Types in Java**

In Java, **data types** are divided into two categories: **Primitive** and **Non-Primitive**.

# üî• Primitive Data Types in Java

Java has **8 primitive data types** that are predefined by the language. These types represent raw values in memory and are the building blocks for more complex data structures.

---

## **1. byte**
- **Size**: 1 byte
- **Range**: -128 to 127
- **Default Value**: 0
- **Description**: Used to save memory in large arrays. It's the smallest integer data type.

---

## **2. short**
- **Size**: 2 bytes
- **Range**: -32,768 to 32,767
- **Default Value**: 0
- **Description**: Used to save memory in large arrays, when the range of int is not required.

---

## **3. int**
- **Size**: 4 bytes
- **Range**: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- **Default Value**: 0
- **Description**: The most commonly used integer type in Java for whole numbers.

---

## **4. long**
- **Size**: 8 bytes
- **Range**: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
- **Default Value**: 0L
- **Description**: Used when a wider range than int is needed. A 64-bit integer.

---

## **5. float**
- **Size**: 4 bytes
- **Range**: ¬±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 decimal digits)
- **Default Value**: 0.0f
- **Description**: Used for floating-point numbers with single precision.

---

## **6. double**
- **Size**: 8 bytes
- **Range**: ¬±1.7976931348623157E+308 (15 decimal digits)
- **Default Value**: 0.0d
- **Description**: Used for floating-point numbers with double precision. More precise than float.

---

## **7. char**
- **Size**: 2 bytes
- **Range**: 0 to 65,535 (Unicode characters)
- **Default Value**: '\u0000' (null character)
- **Description**: Used to store a single character, like 'A', '1', etc.

---

## **8. boolean**
- **Size**: 1 bit (JVM dependent)
- **Values**: `true` or `false`
- **Default Value**: `false`
- **Description**: Used for representing logical values (true/false).

---

## **Conclusion**

These primitive data types are not objects but are directly stored in memory. They represent the most basic values, and understanding them is crucial to efficiently working with Java.

---

### ** üî• Non-Primitive Data Types**

In Java, **Non-Primitive Data Types** (also called reference types) are more complex and are defined by the programmer. Unlike primitive data types, non-primitive data types can store references to objects rather than the actual data. These data types can hold multiple values and are generally used to create more complex data structures.

---

## **1. String**
- **Description**: Represents a sequence of characters.
- **Default Value**: `null`
- **Details**: 
  - Strings are **immutable**, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.
  - The `String` class is part of the **java.lang** package, and it has several methods like `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, and many more.
  - A string can be created using double quotes, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`.

### Example:
```java
String str = "Hello, World!";



## **2. Arrays**
- **Description**: A collection of similar data types.
- **Default Value**: `null`
- **Details**: 
  - Arrays can store multiple values of the same type (either primitive or non-primitive).
  - The size of an array is fixed once created.
  - Java arrays are **zero-indexed** (index starts from 0).
  
### Example:
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
String[] names = {"John", "Jane", "Doe"};


## **3. Classes**
- **Description**: A blueprint for creating objects, containing fields (variables) and methods (functions).
- **Default Value**: `null`
- **Details**: 
  - A class defines the structure and behavior of objects created from it.
  - You can create instances (objects) of a class using the `new` keyword.
  - A class can have constructors, methods, fields, and inner classes.
  
### Example:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    // Constructor
    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    // Method
    void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hi, I'm " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

## **4. Interfaces**
- **Description**: A reference type, similar to a class, but it can only contain constants, method signatures, default methods, and static methods.
- **Default Value**: `null`
- **Details**: 
  - Interfaces cannot contain instance fields.
  - Methods in interfaces are abstract by default (no method body).
  - A class can implement multiple interfaces, which allows Java to achieve multiple inheritance.
  
### Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();  // Method signature (no implementation)
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}

## **5. Enums**
- **Description**: A special type of class used to define collections of constants.
- **Default Value**: `null`
- **Details**: 
  - Enums are used to represent a fixed set of constants.
  - Java provides the `enum` keyword to define enums.
  
### Example:
```java
enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY;
}

## **6. Null**
- **Description**: A literal representing the absence of a value.
- **Default Value**: `null`
- **Details**: 
  - `null` is used to indicate that an object reference does not point to any object in memory.
  - `null` can be assigned to any reference type variable (objects, arrays, etc.).
  
### Example:
```java
String str = null;  // str is not pointing to any string object

# üõ†Ô∏è Variables in Java

In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. Every variable in Java is associated with a data type, which defines what kind of data it can hold. Variables are used to store values and enable us to perform operations on them.

---

## **Types of Variables in Java**

Java has three main types of variables: **Local Variables**, **Instance Variables**, and **Class (Static) Variables**.

### 1. **Local Variables**
- **Description**: Local variables are declared inside a method, constructor, or block. They are only accessible within the method or block where they are defined.
- **Scope**: The scope of a local variable is limited to the method or block in which it is declared.
- **Lifetime**: Local variables are created when the method/block is called and are destroyed when the method/block execution is complete.
- **Default Value**: Local variables are **not** initialized by default, and an attempt to use them without initialization will result in a compilation error.

#### Example:
```java
public void greet() {
    String greeting = "Hello, World!";  // Local variable
    System.out.println(greeting);
}

## **2. Instance Variables**
- **Description**: Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside of any method or constructor. They represent the state of an object and are unique to each instance of the class.
- **Scope**: Instance variables can be accessed by all methods and constructors in the class.
- **Lifetime**: The lifetime of instance variables is tied to the lifetime of the object they belong to.
- **Default Value**: Instance variables are initialized with default values:
  - `0` for numeric types
  - `false` for `boolean`
  - `null` for object references
  
### Example:
```java
class Person {
    String name;  // Instance variable
    int age;      // Instance variable

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

## **3. Class (Static) Variables**
- **Description**: Class variables are declared with the `static` keyword inside a class. These variables are shared among all instances of the class.
- **Scope**: Class variables are accessible by all methods, constructors, and objects of the class.
- **Lifetime**: Class variables are created when the class is loaded into memory and destroyed when the program terminates.
- **Default Value**: Class variables are initialized with default values, similar to instance variables.

### Example:
```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0;  // Class variable

    public Counter() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    }
}


# üõ†Ô∏è **Variable Data Types in Java**

In Java, variables are strongly typed, meaning each variable is explicitly defined with a type, and you cannot store incompatible data types in a variable.

---

## **Primitive Data Types**:
These hold single values and are the building blocks of all data types in Java. Examples include:
- `int`
- `float`
- `double`
- `char`
- `boolean`
- etc.

---

## **Reference Data Types**:
These variables store references (or memory addresses) to objects. Examples include:
- **Objects** (e.g., `String`, `Person`, etc.)
- **Arrays**
- **Interfaces**

---

## **Variable Initialization**
Variables in Java must be initialized before they are used. The initialization process assigns a value to the variable, either during declaration or in a constructor or method.

### Example:
```java
int number = 5;  // Initialized at the time of declaration
String name = "Alice";  // Initialized at the time of declaration


## **Final Variables**
A **final** variable cannot be modified once initialized. It acts as a constant and is often used to define values that should not change.

### Example:
```java
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;  // final variable (constant)

## **Variable Naming Conventions**
Java has specific conventions for naming variables to make the code readable and maintainable:

1. **CamelCase**: Variables should start with a lowercase letter and use camel case for multi-word variables (e.g., `firstName`, `totalAmount`).
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful names that describe the variable's purpose (e.g., `studentAge` instead of `x`).
3. **No Reserved Keywords**: Avoid using Java keywords (e.g., `int`, `class`, `public`, etc.) as variable names.
4. **Start with a Letter**: Variable names must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z), a dollar sign (`$`), or an underscore (`_`).
5. **No Special Characters**: Avoid using special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`, etc.).

## **3. Type Casting in Java**

**Type Casting** is the process of converting one data type to another. In Java, there are two types of type casting:

### **3.1 Implicit Type Casting (Widening Conversion)**
- **Description**: It automatically converts a smaller type to a larger type.
- **Example**:
```java
int num = 10;
double result = num;  // int to double (widening) --  // int is automatically converted to double
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 10.0

### üîÅ **Common Widening Conversions**
```text
byte ‚Üí short ‚Üí int ‚Üí long ‚Üí float ‚Üí double

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. 2. Explicit Type Casting (Narrowing Conversion)

- Also known as **manual type conversion**.
- Happens when a **larger data type** is explicitly converted to a **smaller data type**.
- Risky because it can lead to **data loss**.
- Done by the **programmer** using cast operator `(type)`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Example:
```java
double value = 10.75;
int result = (int) value;  // Manual conversion: double to int
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 10 (fractional part is lost)

### üîÅ **Common Narrowing Conversions**
```text
double ‚Üí float ‚Üí long ‚Üí int ‚Üí short ‚Üí byte

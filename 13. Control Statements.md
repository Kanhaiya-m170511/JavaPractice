# Control Statements in Java

Control statements in Java are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. These statements allow you to control the decision-making process and loop execution.

## 1. if-else Statement

The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed. Otherwise, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

```java
int number = 10;
if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is negative or zero");
}
```
## 2. if-else-if Ladder
Used when you have multiple conditions to check, the if-else-if ladder allows you to test more than two conditions.
```java
int number = 10;
if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
} else if (number < 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is negative");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is zero");
}
```
## 3. switch Statement
The switch statement evaluates an expression and matches the value against multiple case labels. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```
- Note: The break statement is important to prevent the execution of subsequent case blocks after a match is found.

## 4. Loops in Java
- a) for Loop
The for loop is used when you know how many times you need to iterate through a block of code.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
- b) while Loop
The while loop is used when you need to loop based on a condition. The condition is evaluated before each iteration.

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```
- c) do-while Loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, except the condition is checked after the loop has executed. This guarantees that the loop will run at least once.
```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
- 5. Break Statement
The break statement is used to exit from a loop or a switch statement. It immediately terminates the current loop and moves on to the next statement after the loop.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;  // Exits the loop when i equals 3
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
- 6. continue Statement
The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;  // Skips the iteration when i equals 3
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
- 7. return Statement
The return statement is used to exit from a method and optionally return a value.
```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;  // Returns the sum of a and b
}
```
- 8. Labeled Statements (Used with break and continue)
Labeled statements are used to apply break or continue to specific loops. This is especially useful when working with nested loops.
```java
outerLoop:
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (i == 1 && j == 1) {
            break outerLoop;  // Exits both loops when i=1 and j=1
        }
        System.out.println("i: " + i + ", j: " + j);
    }
}
```
- 9. assert Statement (Optional)
The assert statement is used for debugging purposes. It's used to test assumptions and catch bugs in the code during development. Assertions are disabled by default at runtime, and they can be enabled using the -ea option when running the JVM.
```java
int age = -1;
assert age >= 0 : "Age cannot be negative";  // This will throw an AssertionError if age is negative

```
```java
Syntax:
assert condition;
assert condition : message;
```
- Note: You can enable assertions with the command-line option -ea (enable assertions) when running the program.


### Summary:
- if-else: Used for decision-making based on a condition.
- switch: Used when you need to compare a value with multiple options.
- for, while, do-while loops: Used to repeat a block of code based on conditions.
- break: Exits from loops or switch statements.
- continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop.
- return: Exits from a method and optionally returns a value.
- Labeled Statements: Used to break or continue specific loops, especially with nested loops.

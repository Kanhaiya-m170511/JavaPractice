# Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to be write once, run anywhere (WORA).


# 📜 History of Java

- **1991** – Started as "Oak" by James Gosling for embedded devices.
- **1995** – Renamed to Java and released publicly.
- **Present** – Maintained by Oracle, widely used in enterprise, Android, and cloud development.

# 🌟 Key Characteristics
# Feature	Description
- **Object-Oriented** :	Java uses classes and objects to structure code.
- **Platform Independent**:	Java code runs on any machine with a JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- **Simple and Secure**:	Java removes complex features (like pointers) and includes security features like bytecode verification.
- **Robust**:	Strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection make Java reliable.
- **Multithreaded**:	Java supports concurrent programming via threads.
- **High Performance**:	Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler boosts runtime performance.
- **Dynamic and Extensible**:	Java supports dynamic linking and reflection for runtime class loading.


# 🔁 Java Execution Flow
``` java
  // HelloWorld.java
  public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
      }
  }
```
# 💡 Compilation and Execution Process:

$ javac HelloWorld.java → Compiles to HelloWorld.class (Bytecode)

$ java HelloWorld → JVM executes the bytecode

# 🛠 Java Editions
  # Edition	Use Case
- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**:	Core Java, desktop apps, basic APIs
- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**:	Web & enterprise applications (now Jakarta EE)
- **Java ME (Micro Edition)**:	Embedded & mobile devices
- **JavaFX**	Rich GUI apps

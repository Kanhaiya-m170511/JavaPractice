# ðŸ’¼ Java Interview Questions: Wrapper Classes

## ðŸ”¹ **Beginner Level**

1. **What are wrapper classes in Java?**
2. **What is the purpose of wrapper classes in Java?**
3. **Can we create an object of a primitive data type? Why or why not?**
4. **What is the difference between primitive types and wrapper classes?**
5. **How do you convert a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class (autoboxing)?**
6. **How do you convert a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type (unboxing)?**
7. **What are the wrapper classes available in Java?**
8. **What is the default value of a wrapper class object?**
9. **Can we use wrapper classes in collections? Why?**
10. **What is the default value of an `Integer` object in Java?**

## ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Level**

11. **Explain autoboxing and unboxing with examples.**
12. **What is the range of the `Integer` class in Java?**
13. **What will happen if we try to use a primitive type and its wrapper class interchangeably in a collection?**
14. **What is the significance of `Integer.parseInt()` and `Double.parseDouble()` methods in Java?**
15. **How do wrapper classes compare objects with `==` and `equals()` methods?**
16. **Why does comparing wrapper objects using `==` sometimes give unexpected results?**
17. **What is the internal caching of wrapper classes in Java?**
18. **How does Java handle object caching in the `Integer` class?**
19. **What is the benefit of using wrapper classes over primitives?**
20. **How can we convert a String to a wrapper class object, e.g., from String to Integer?**

## ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Level**

21. **Explain the concept of object caching in wrapper classes with respect to `Integer` and `Character`.**
22. **How does autoboxing affect the performance of Java programs?**
23. **What are some potential pitfalls or issues when using wrapper classes in high-performance applications?**
24. **What would happen if you try to unbox a null wrapper object?**
25. **Can you modify the value of a final wrapper class object? Why or why not?**
26. **Explain the behavior of `==` when comparing two different wrapper class objects, such as `Integer` or `Boolean`.**
27. **Can wrapper class objects be used in serialization? Explain with an example.**
28. **What are the benefits and drawbacks of using wrapper classes in multi-threaded environments?**
29. **How do wrapper classes handle null values during conversion?**
30. **What is the use of `valueOf()` method in wrapper classes like `Integer.valueOf()` and `Double.valueOf()`?**

## âœ… Additional Thoughts:
- These questions cover a **range of topics** from basic understanding to **performance implications** and **object caching** in wrapper classes.
- It's important to understand how Java's **autoboxing** and **unboxing** can **impact performance** and how **memory management** works with wrapper objects.
- For **advanced topics**, understanding the **internal workings of wrapper classes** (e.g., object caching) can give you an edge during interviews.
